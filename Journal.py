- Initial set up of the project, figured it would be good to start with:
1) Set up Github repo
2) Set up virtual env 
    - had to run:: sudo /usr/bin/easy_install virtualenv
    - Create virtual env:: virtualenv env 
    - Run the virtual env with:: source env/bin/activate
    - Once in the env, pip install (e.g. pip install flask)
    - 
3) Set up server file with boilter plate Flask  
4) Write routes 
5) Get first HTML up on localhost 
6) Possibly set up my DB (Postgres)
